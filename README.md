# Automated-Tests-Notebook
This is a personal guide and roadmap, created for the purpose of coding automised testing methods for future reference. 


A wee paradigm as a keepsake for the mind: 

**Complexity of tests engineering**:  

<span style="color: orange"> Unit Tests:  </span>
✑ One function test method (Completely Isolated Testing): Low;
<span style="color: red"> Integration Tests: </span>
✑ Functions with callbacks and dependencies: Moderate;
<span style="color: purple"> End to End Tests: </span>
✑ Full Flow: High
